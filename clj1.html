    <h1>The Causes of Criminal Activities in the Society</h1>
</div>
<div class="essay">
    <p>Crime is an illegal action done against a certain constitution and is punishable by law. In other words its something against the law. This includes robbery, burglary, kidnapping, drug and human trafficking, terrorism and homicide just to name a few. Thou there are other definitions for crime, we will focus on the one mentioned. Mostly crime is done intentionally due to certain factors in order to achieve satisfaction by the doer. There is need to know these causes because with them comes a solution to ending crime.</p>
    <p>The most common cause of crime is poverty. The high economy rate has increased poverty levels in the world. This is mostly caused by unemployment, loosing a source of income which leads to low living standards. If this condition becomes critical, it leads to poverty. Over 1 billion children are living in poverty. They do anything to keep surviving including crime, due to the hunger.</p>
    <p>Another cause of crime is drugs. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has recorder to have seized over 250 metric tons of drugs. In 2018, around 269 million people used drugs. This has promoted drug trafficking and formation of cartels who control the businesses. Drug uses might also commit crimes due to the influence of drugs like cocaine,morphine and heroine. Drug trafficking goes hand in hand with breaking many federal laws.</p>
    <p>The next main cause of crime is politics. This happens in a very secretive way and not everyone is concerned. The crimes involved include homicides, piracy (especially in higher positions), treason, and even banditry where they hire people to do the crimes. They are mostly done by dirty politicians who want more power and money. They do the victimless crime either for the government or to the government. All these are due to the position in political seats which have shown much temptations to commit crime.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, crime does have more causes from the little peer pressure to family to religion. I would advise everyone to stay out of doing crime and avoid the causes as much as possible. <br>When the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace. - Jimi Hendrix</p>
