    <h1>Health in Sports</h1>
</div>
<div class="essay">
    <p>Sports have a great impact on health as well as health has for the sports. Doing exercise may influence our health in one way or another. health too might influence sports for example it determines which sports our bodies should take. Both have a great impact on our well-being and lives. Sometimes we may experience fatigue faster than normal during regular exercise, or finding that you get fatigued quicker than another person. This is not particularly a health problem but finding out why can really help. In the below paragraphs I shall discuss how health and sports relate to each other.</p>
    <p>Health has become a part of certain sports playing. Some sports such as athletics need healthy bodies. Others might even require tests before undertaking the sports. This is because some players use drugs that increase their health ability, making them suitable than others. Sports such as boxing, basketball and football (including soccer) require a healthy body to participate while other outdoor sports like golf require less strong bodies. This means that you can do less exercise for golf but more exercise for boxing. This leads to the difference in diet for different sports.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, sports have a great influence on an individual health. Certain sports may such as football and gymnastics sometimes cause injuries to the players. They may result to broken bones, deteriorating a person's health and even worse. For example the famous swimmer Fran Crippen who passed away in his 2010 swimming competition. Other health issues related to sports are brain concussions, common in football, hockey and boxing. It means that you already have a damage to a vital organ in your body. Sports may also lead to using doping agents in order to win.</p>
    <p>A major factor relating these two is the purpose of doing sports, one of them which turns out to be health. Most doctors recommend regular exercise to patients with high blood sugar level. Obese people do exercise to burn down the fat and stay healthy. Research has shown that people participating in sports are more healthy and less resistance to diseases than those not in sports. Doing physical exercise lowers the risk of diseases such as diabetes. Sports related with plenty of exercise maintain a good homeostatic value in our bodies, and helps it excrete metabolic waste properly without any complications</p>
    <p>The conclusion might be quit clear to many of us. That sports promote good health and health promotes good sporting activities. Basically, both rely on each other on a deeper focus, they go hand in hand. </p>
