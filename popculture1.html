    <p>What is pop culture? I would define it as a modern form of lifestyle which is mostly spread via mass media. This form of culture is mostly meant and aimed for the teenagers and by far even younger people. It can be in form of music, fashion, news, politics and technology. All these forms of this modern culture have majorly affected teenagers in good ways and bad ways. Below is a summary of the major effects of pop culture.<p>
    <p>Pop culture has led to the rise of most activist groups especially in the West. This includes religious and political group that have influenced teenagers to be part of. Some make people aware of their rights as well as exercising them in a good way. The activities made by these groups mostly start online. This affects how the teenagers talk and act. Some may bring a positive behaviour while others may bring a negative behaviour. They basically control the attitude the youths grow up with. It also brings out the sense and understanding of a particular group or maybe a place in the community. This culture has simply made a connection between the youths and the world.</p>
    <p>Pop Culture has turned out to be the most informative thing in the world. Almost every solution to our daily problems has been answered through the mass media, such as news, fashion and the internet at large. It has influenced young people to make solutions and share them, making them innovative. It makes them known for their work and abilities, leading to different opportunities. this has provided job opportunities, reducing the dependancy rate. There might also be some negativity from this that some youths are now dependent to the pop culture for every little problems they get, making them lazy.</p>
    <p>As to others the pop culture might be a source of knowledge and well being, it has also brought out some negative impact to the teenagers. This includes drugs and violence, which is mostly a result of the peer pressure from surrounding social media and television. Another common negative influence is sex, mostly from the music industry. Once teenagers have adapt to these influences, it does result to pessimistic behaviours. It might lead to rejection from friends or self esteem and self hate among the youths.</p>
    <p>The youth might have been affected by pop culture in one way or another. In conclusion, its all about how the different forms of pop culture are being used. If correctly used, it will bring a positive impact to the society, and if used wrongly, there might be some consequences associated by a negative impact.</p>
