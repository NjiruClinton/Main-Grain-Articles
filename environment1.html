    <h1>Pollution on the Environment.</h1>

<div class="essay">
    <p>Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause unfavourable change. Pollution can take the form of chemical substances or energy, such as noise, heat, or light. Pollutants, the components of pollution, can be either foreign substances/energies or naturally occurring contaminants. It affects the environment in which we live in. In 2015, pollution killed 9 million people worldwide. This shows how environmental pollution is both dangerous and disadvantageous to human beings</p>
    <p>Pollution has many effect and the worst is on human health. Adverse air pollution, such as industrious gases cause respiratory diseases among humans with close contact on the gases. This includes chest pains, asthma, lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. Water pollution can lead to fatal diseases that mostly leads to death such as cholera, diarrhoea, hepatitis A, polio and typhoid. Water pollution also leads to other factors like infant mortality. This like oil spillage might cause skin burn to swimmers.</p>
    <p>The next big effect of pollution is on the environment itself. Water pollution depletes aquatic ecosystem destroying the biodiversity around. This pollution has led to increased rate of plant and aquatic creatures going extinct. Radio active substances on the ground kill all micro-organisms disabling further growth. Noise pollution from big machines and airplanes tends to scare birds from the places. This explains why you will rarely see birds in areas such as mining sites and large airports.</p>
    <p>Land pollution has also become a growing burden especially in third world countries. Trash is the most common form of land pollution. Garbage contains harmful chemicals that damage the environment when disposed on land. The oils and chemicals may also leech deep into the ground destroying the lands fertility. Animals can die from eating the trash unknowingly because of the plastic.</p>
    <p>As we've seen the effects of pollution on the environment, we should be able to solve most causes. Everyone around the world should be fighting against pollution in the many open ways. This includes recycling waste and garbage. The government should also put up strict laws on polluting the environment. Industries with gaseous, liquids and solid waste should make sure to recycle them or make them unharmful to human beings and the environment.</p>
